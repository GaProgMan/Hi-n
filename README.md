# Hi-n
Hi\n is an esoteric joke language created and described at https://esolangs.org

For a full description of the language, including it's history and design, see: http://esolangs.org/wiki/Hi%5Cn

# Short Description of Hi\n

Taken from the eslonag entry for Hi\n:

> The program must do the following things in this order to be considered a hi\n interpreter:
 * It must instantiate the string "eat pie" exactly 98 times, using a for loop.
 * It must set the variable 'x' to a string containing exactly 1,000,000 'a's.
 * It must set the variable 'squiggly' to the square root of 5.
 * Most importantly, it must print 'hi' with a trailing newline.

# Project
This repo will contain a listing of Hi\n in every language and framework that I am competent enough in to produce it with.

These languages will include (at least, to start with):

 * C/C++ (uploaded: hi.cpp)
 * C# (uploaded: hi.cs)
 * Javascript (uploaded: hi.js)
